# Jumpstart

This project plan provides an overview of the scope and objectives of the ecommerce website development project for Jumpstart, a retail chain. The project aims to create a user-friendly and secure online platform that allows customers to purchase products from Jumpstart's inventory and have them delivered to their preferred locations. The project also seeks to enhance the operational efficiency of Jumpstart by integrating the ecommerce website with its existing systems and optimizing its business processes.

The project is aligned with the digital transformation trends that have reshaped the business landscape, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The project will enable Jumpstart to leverage the benefits of remote working, such as reduced costs, increased flexibility, and improved customer satisfaction. The project will also help Jumpstart to adapt to the changing customer behaviour and preferences, as more people opt for online shopping over physical stores.
